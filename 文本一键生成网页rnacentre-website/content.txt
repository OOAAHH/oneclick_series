1.2 Roles & Expectations 
Our group consists of Students, Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and Core Staffs. Here, we describe the responsibilities of each role, challenges they may face, what you can expect from them, and in return what they can expect from you. 
Students 
Who do we mean? Anyone actively working toward a research degree, including Masters and PhD students, and both university-enrolled and visiting students. 
Day-to-day: Students are responsible for much of the research in our group. The vast majority of their time is dedicated to their own research project, but they also do other “research adjacent” work. A week typically includes: supervisions, one-to-ones with other group members, general lab meetings, and educational activities. 
Support for students: Students are trained professionals and their ideas should be taken seriously by the entire group. Students can expect to meet with their supervisors regularly in a supportive environment. They should feel empowered to point out mistakes made by group members or admit when they do not understand something. Supervisors should provide regular feedback and encourage students to develop their own ideas to progress their project. In our group, students will also be given opportunities to: 1. Get access to various research resources; 2. Interact with world-known scientists, or attend international conferences. 
Expectations of students: Students are an integral part of the wider lab and frequently play a crucial role volunteering to help with tasks the group needs to function. Supervisors can expect students to provide regular updates on their progress, and participate actively in group activities. Students are expected to recognise that their research is a form of training and struggles are a part of the learning process. 
Students is the beginning stage of scientific research. 
Bachelor students are expected to stay in the group for more than 3 month and finish a mini project. She/he takes the first flavour of scientific research. Good students will be given the chance for a Master/PhD degree. 
Master students are expected to start her/his research by mimicking other established work or by supporting the projects from PhD students or postdocs. On graduation, she/he: (1) knows how a research project works; (2) finishes part of a PhD project work and publish the paper on a SCI journal or publish the paper as a co-first author on a decent journal. Good students will be given the chance for a PhD degree. 
PhD students are expected to have a complete scientific training from conceiving an idea, to coding, to paper writing. On graduation, she/he MUST: (1) have a complete overview of the research field; (2) knows how to play a leading role (first/co-first author) in a research project; (3) finishes the research project and publish the paper on a decent journal (e.g., Nature Communications.); (4) can interact with the research community. The top PhD students may already have achieved (1-3) in their first year. This should also be the aim of all PhD students and pre-PhDs.  
Challenges: Navigating a first major research project is a difficult task. To be successful, students must also develop “soft skills” including effective communication and time management. Unexpected difficulties are part of the research process - learning how to cope with setbacks takes experience, fortitude, and patience. These stressors can be exacerbated by additional factors throughout the degree, including the isolation of leading a research project, difficulty navigating work-life balance, and distance from long-standing support networks. 

Early Career Researchers (ECRs) 
Who do we mean? Postdoctoral researchers, Assistant Investigators and Associate Investigators (coPIs)
Day-to-day: The ECR stage is marked by a transition to increasing independence. ECRs spend the majority of time on their own research, whilst also collaborating on a broader range of projects. ECRs often have several further responsibilities, including sitting on committees, student supervision, and teaching. ECRs may also be asked to stand in for PIs when required, and help with or lead grant applications. 
Support for ECRs: ECRs can expect senior group members to dedicate time to their career development, alongside practical advice and feedback on their progress. Senior members should create opportunities for ECRs to take on increased responsibility, grow independence, and interact with the wider research community. Where ECRs are involved in supervision, students should take ECR guidance seriously, respect other demands on their time, and ensure their contributions receive appropriate credit. 
Expectations of ECRs: Having recently navigated a PhD/DPhil themselves, ECRs can provide valuable support to a student’s career development. ECRs often have more time than PIs to guide students in their research, can advocate on a student’s behalf, and often know who to approach when particular issues arise. PIs can expect ECRs to facilitate the dissemination of expertise in the group, and support students by providing crucial constructive feedback. 
ECRs are expected to develop abilities on 3 aspects: (1) Finish the research project and publish the paper on a decent journal (e.g., Nature Communications.); (2) Play a leading role in a project and guide the team (students, staff); (3) Get external funding support. Postdocs are expected to have at least a decent publication or a funding during the training. Associate Investigators are expected to get funding and publish research works regularly. 
Challenges: Transitioning to increased independence places considerable responsibility on new ECRs. The role is often accompanied by changes in research group and/or topic, which requires adjustment. ECR positions are inherently transitional, and this stage in a researcher's career is often accompanied by growing personal commitments (e.g., starting a family). Managing a diversifying workload, the uncertainty associated with fixed-term contracts, and reduced supervisory support can be difficult.  

Research Assistants
Who do we mean? Core Staffs and perspective PhD students (pre-PhDs). 
Day-to-day: 
Core staffs are highly trained individuals, often with unique expertise (e.g., data curation, building workflows). When their contributions go beyond what would be considered conventional ‘support’, they should be recognised appropriately (for example, co-authorship on an upcoming publication). Core staffs normally belong to the service team supporting other members in the group. Core staffs also need to get involved in the administrative works. But core staffs are also encouraged to make key contributions in research.
pre-PhDs are potential candidates to get a PhD degree in the group. pre-PhDs are competing for the PhD admission, so she/he needs to demonstrate the research ability in the group as soon as possible. pre-PhDs should work as hard as PhD students. pre-PhDs need to support the group’s research as well and show their teamwork ability. 
Expectations of pre-PhDs: pre-PhDs normally need to demonstrate a certain degree of ability before coming to the group. (e.g., ITELS > 6.5 grades, first-author publications). To shorten the competition period, some pre-PhDs need to finish a mini project within 3-4 months. Most pre-PhDs who become a PhD student should finish a manuscript before the start of PhD. 
 
Challenges: pre-PhDs are competing for the PhD admission. PhD admission considers all candidates in a fair way but cannot be controlled by the PIs. The only certain thing is that the PI will be as fair as possible when making the judgement. pre-PhDs need to play a leading role and finish a manuscript ASAP. pre-PhDs can ask all other people in the group for help to accelerate the research progress.
